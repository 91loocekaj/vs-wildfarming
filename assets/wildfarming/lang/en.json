<strong>Seed Extraction And Plant Reproduction</strong>
Seeds from grain can be extracted by putting it into a crafting grid with a wooden pan.
Seeds from vegetables and legumes can be extracted using shears in the crafting grid.
Reed roots and vine tips can be grown and split into two by putting them in the crafting grid with a full bucket of water.
Place vine tips up somewhere high, and the tip will grow down leaving vine sections you can harvest.
Place seaweed trimmings in deep water and they will grow up, leaving seaweed you can harvest
Seeds for flowers, fruits, cacti, and fern can be extracted with a knife in the crafting grid. These seeds do not require farmland or water, but they are sensitive to temperature and will get a heat boost in a greenhouse.
Pine trees can be scored with a knife to leak resin.

<strong>Mushroom Farming</strong>
To start farming mushrooms you will need <a href=\"handbook://block-wildfarming:mushroomsubstrate\">mushroom substrate</a> and the mushroom you want to grow. Right clicking on the substrate with the mushroom will set it. For ground mushrooms, they will grow with in 7 blocks of the substrate randomly on dirt that is on the same level as the substrate. For side growing mushrooms place 5 logs on top of the substrate that match the mushrooms preferred type and they will grow on the sides of the log.

<strong>Tree Farming</strong>
All saplings/trees have specific needs in order to grow them. They must all in a certain temperature range. The trunk of the tree will tell you if it is too hot or too cold. Trees will regenerate leaves if they meet the above criteria and the place where the leaves should go is not blocked. Tree health is 50% based on the amount of leaves and 50% based on the health of the wood. Breaking or blocking leaves will reduce its leaf health. Parasites like termites will reduce its log health. Trees grow into the next stage if they have at least 85% health. Leaves and branches will regenerate BUT destroying a log will kill the tree and the trunk will die and turn into a regular log. Fully grown trees will attract different flora and will plant more saplings in the area if at least 75% health. Be careful though, as fully grown trees can also attract harmful organisms like termites. Note: Bamboo and fern trees are not “living”.
